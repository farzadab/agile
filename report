fits new data, then extends the old and fits sample of 4 times the new data
(doesn't go up, best is good, end is good)

optim2: optim.SGD(net.parameters(), lr=0.001, momentum=0.9)
(-xx) Jun01_16-32-19_farzad-desktop - Adam 128: goes down at first, but then goes up and plateaus
(+++) Jun01_16-45-43_farzad-desktop - SGD  512: goes down slower but seems to be stable (always going down), also it maybe that it has plateaued at the end
(---) Jun01_17-00-31_farzad-desktop - Adam 512: goes down really fast at first, but then goes up agan and plateaus (almost the same as Adam 128: two rows above)
(x-x) Jun01_17-14-55_farzad-desktop - Adam 512 but fits whole data every single time (almost the same as Adam 512 row above, but worse)
(x+-) Jun01_17-23-49_farzad-desktop - Adam 512 but only mpc: goes lower than all the rest and faster, but goes back up
(-++) Jun01_17-31-30_farzad-desktop - Adam 1024: almost the same as above, but a less variation: doesn't go up as high in the end
(xxx) Jun01_17-35-58_farzad-desktop - Adam 512  lr=0.003 (original lr=0.001): goes down really fast at first but quickly (faster than others) goes up high
(+-+) Jun01_17-46-04_farzad-desktop - Adam 1024 lr=0.0003: goes down constant
(+--) Jun01_18-17-04_farzad-desktop - Adam 512  lr=0.0003: doesn't go up, but ends just short of Adam 512
(+--) Jun01_17-52-03_farzad-desktop - SGD  1024: starts high goes down constantly but it still ends high
(+++) Jun01_17-55-53_farzad-desktop - SGD  1024 lr=0.003 (original lr=0.001): starts high but goes down steadily (finishes almost the same as Adam 1024 lr=0.0003)
(+xx) Jun01_18-00-39_farzad-desktop - SGD  1024 lr=0.0003: starts high
(+++) Jun01_18-04-12_farzad-desktop - SGD 512 but only mpc: constant decrease and the best result (almost the same as SGD 512 but lower)!

high-level results:
  - Adam tends to go up unless conservative lr and batch_size are chosen (Adam 1024 lr=0.0003)
    - only 1024 almost works. haven't tried only lr=0.0003 
  - "only MPC" is better than randomizing on both Adam and SGD
    - not sure if it's better overall or just in on-policy trajs (but our MPC is not too on-policy anyway)
  - "fits whole data every time" doesn't seem to work, but maybe more conservative lr might help: doesn't need as much data
