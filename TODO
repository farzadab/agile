TODO:
    ☐ experiment with half-cheetah
    ✔ check pytorch optimization issues @critical @done(18-06-01 18:07)
        ✔ is it converging? @done(18-06-01 18:07)
        ✔ normalization @started(18-05-31 17:34) @done(18-06-01 18:07) @lasted(1d33m1s)
        ✔ correct optimization algorithm and batch size @started(18-05-31 17:34) @done(18-06-01 18:07) @lasted(1d33m2s)
            ✔ hyper-parameters @started(18-06-01 18:07) @done(18-06-04 12:58) @lasted(2d18h51m45s)
            ✔ checkout results and make more experiments @done(18-06-04 12:58)
    ☐ check the model for torque limits/mass/....
    ☐ start with a simpler model: no feet @almost
        ☐ or perhaps the model with compliant feet @almost
    ✔ add PD controller: is it going to help or not? @done(18-05-30 13:44)
    ✔ use vx for cost @done(18-05-30 15:03)
        ☐ check if cost function is working or not
    ☐ gotta get rid of "done" from the env and develop my own
        - just use timelimit for now?
    ✔ checkout cost function code from baseline paper: https://github.com/nagaban2/nn_dynamics/blob/master/reward_functions.py @done(18-06-04 12:51)
        - both this one and the homework code uses forward torso x vel + 0.05*action^2 @done(18-06-04 12:53)
        - homework code also adds some hand-engineered costs (penalizes bad configs of legs) @done(18-06-04 12:54)
    ☐ drive simple motions: fix some joints and experiment with the rest (e.g. sinosuid)
    ☐ faster MPC with multiple rollout @speed

Relevant:
    ☐ active learning?
